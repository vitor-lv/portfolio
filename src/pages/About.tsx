        <p>
          I'm a product designer with experience building digital experiences
          for high-scale platforms. I care deeply about hierarchy, usability,
          storytelling and the little details that make a product feel premium.
        </p>

        <p>
          I enjoy working with design systems, experimentation and teams that
          value craft.
